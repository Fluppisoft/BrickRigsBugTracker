# Brick Rigs Bug Tracker

This repository contains the bug tracker for our game [Brick Rigs](https://fluppisoft.com/brick-rigs/). If you encounter bugs inside the game, this is the right place to report them.

We try our best to look at the reports and develop appropriate fixes for them. If you can get a friend to reproduce the issue on their system, there is a good chance the developers will be able to reproduce it themselves, given a good description from your side. However if the bug report boils down to "The game crashed, but I can't reproduce it and I don't know what I did" it will be exceedingly unlikely that we can act on that information.

## Mods

Mods are third-party additions to the game and outside of our control, so we can't help with issues that are caused by them. If the issue only happens when certain mods are installed, please contact the mod authors themselves. **This is not the right place to report mod related issues!**
