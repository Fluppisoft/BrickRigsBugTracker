# Brick Rigs Bug Tracker

This repository contains the bug tracker for the [Brick Rigs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/552100/Brick_Rigs/) game. If you encounter issues inside the game or crashes, this is the right place to report those.

The developers of the game try their best to look at the reports and develop appropriate fixes for them. If you can get a friend to reproduce the issue on their computer, there is a good chance the developers will be able to reproduce it themselves, given a good description from your side. However if the bug report boils down to "The game crashed, but I can't reproduce it and I don't know what I did" it will be exceedingly unlikely that the developers can act on that information.

## Mods

Mods are great additions to the game and the game developers actively help community modders in developing them, for example [here](TODO) is the mod-kit you can use to create your own mods. However since mods are third-party additions to the game and outside the control of the game developers, they can't help with issues that are caused by mods. If the issue only happens when certain mods are installed, please contact the mod authors themselves. This is *not* the right place to report mod related issues.
